Problem Statement
Background: The hotel industry heavily relies on accurate booking predictions to optimize operations, manage resources effectively, and provide a seamless guest experience. By analyzing historical data, it is possible to build machine learning models that can predict whether a hotel booking is likely to be canceled or not. This information can help hotels make informed decisions and allocate resources accordingly.

Dataset Information: The dataset used in this project is the "Hotel Bookings" dataset, which contains information about bookings made in two hotels: a resort hotel and a city hotel. The dataset includes various features such as guest demographics, booking details, room type, meal arrangement, and booking status (whether the booking was canceled or not). It provides a comprehensive view of hotel bookings and serves as a valuable resource for building prediction models.
Dataset Link: The dataset used in the project can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand

Objective and Description of Project: The objective of this project is to predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not based on various features available in the dataset. The dataset contains various features such as the lead time, arrival date, number of nights, number of adults/children, etc. The task is to build a machine learning model that can predict the probability of a booking getting canceled and assist hotel management in understanding booking patterns and making informed decisions. The model will enable hotels to optimize their resources, improve revenue management, and enhance the overall guest experience by efficiently handling bookings.

A brief explanation of the outputs of the Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction Project 
The outputs of the project include:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing steps, including handling missing data and transforming categorical data into numerical data
2. Exploratory data analysis, including visualizations to identify patterns and relationships in the data
3. Implementation of several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and neural networks, to predict hotel booking cancellations
4. Evaluation of the model performance using different performance metrics such as Accuracy.
5. Comparison of the performance of different models and selection of the best model based on the evaluation metrics
6. Feature importance analysis to identify the most important features that influence the hotel booking cancellations
7. Prediction of the likelihood of a booking being canceled for new booking information using the selected model
8. Conclusion and recommendations based on the analysis, including suggestions for improving the model performance and insights into the factors that affect hotel booking cancellations.

9. Description of Output: The main output of this project is the predicted likelihood of a hotel booking being canceled for new booking information, based on the selected machine learning model. The project compares the performance of several algorithms and selects the best performing model to predict the booking cancellations. The predicted likelihood of a booking being canceled can be used by the hotel management to optimize their booking strategies and reduce the number of cancellations.

Approach:
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Identifying Patterns Scale numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale.
2. Feature Engineering: training.
3. Model Training and Evaluation: Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost etc. Evaluate the performance of each model using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
4. Model Comparison and Selection: identify the most accurate and reliable model for hotel booking prediction. Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
5. Model Deployment and Usage: Utilize the model to predict the likelihood of booking cancellations in real-time. Monitor and analyze model performance regularly to ensure its effectiveness and make necessary adjustments if required.

Framework 
Importing Required Libraries: Begin by importing the necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. These libraries will be used for data manipulation, visualization, and building machine learning models. 
Loading the Dataset: Read the "Hotel Bookings" dataset using the pandas library's read_csv() function. The dataset should be stored in a suitable location. Display the first few rows of the dataset using the head() function to understand its structure and contents.

Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to create meaningful plots and identify patterns in the data. Check for missing values using the isna().sum() function and calculate the percentage of null values for each feature. Handle missing values by filling them with appropriate values. In the provided code, the fillna() function is used to replace missing values with zeros. Visualize missing values using the msno.bar() function from the missingno library to get a visual representation of the missing data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Explore the countries from which the most guests are coming using visualizations like choropleth maps. Analyze the distribution of room prices per night based on different room types using box plots. to identify seasonal patterns.

Data Preprocessing: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using mapping or one-hot encoding. Normalize numerical variables to ensure they are on a similar scale.

Model Building and Evaluation: 
Testing sets using train_test_split() from scikit-learn. Initialize and train various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, KNearest Neighbors, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier. Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report. Compare the results to identify the most accurate model. Artificial Neural Network (ANN): Convert the target variable into categorical format using to_categorical() from the keras.utils module. Build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using the Keras library. Define the architecture of the model, compile it with appropriate loss and optimization functions, and train the model using the training data. Visualize the training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs to analyze model performance. Evaluate the ANN model using the test data and obtain the accuracy score.

Model Comparison and Selection: accuracy scores for each model. Visualize the model comparison using a bar plot to identify the best-performing model. Model Deployment and Usage: management systems. Utilize the model to predict the likelihood of booking cancellations in real-time. Monitor the performance of the deployed model and make necessary adjustments if required.
